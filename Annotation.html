Organ systems include specialized organs made up of specialized tissues and cells. For example, consider the human digestive system. Each organ has specific roles. In the case of the stomach, one role is to initiate protein breakdown. This process requires a churning motion powered by stomach muscles, as well as digestive juices secreted by the stomach lining. Producing digestive juices, in turn, requires highly specialized cell types: One cell type secretes a proteindigesting enzyme, a second generates concentrated hydrochloric acid, and a third produces mucus, which protects the stomach lining.
